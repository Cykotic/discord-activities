# Discord Activities

This repository enables you to retrieve Discord activities associated with a user's profile on Discord. It aims to simplify the process for developers looking to access and log user activity data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher is required to run the bot.
- **Discord Bot Token**: You must create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and store the token in a `.env` file.


### Note: 

Feel free to improve the code as needed!
